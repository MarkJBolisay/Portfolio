        <td>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.
          It is one of the basic shapes in geometry, and its properties and classifications are studied in various branches of mathematics. Triangles can be classified based on the length of their sides (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene) and the measure of their angles (acute, obtuse, or right)./td>

        <td>A quadrilateral is a polygon with four edges (sides) and four vertices (corners).
          Like triangles, quadrilaterals can vary in shape and size. Some common types of quadrilaterals include squares, rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, and rhombuses. The properties and characteristics of a quadrilateral depend on its specific type. For example, a square is a type of quadrilateral where all four sides are equal in length and all angles are right angles (90 degrees)./td>
